## My process

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- More familiarity some of the different CSS background properties, such as:
  - background-image and the use of multiple images
  - background-position 
  - background-repeat
